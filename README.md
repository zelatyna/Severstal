# Severstal
Deep Learning excercise on Severstal dataset from Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection

Learning objectives:
- perform data exploration
- build deep learning model using U-Net for Image Segmentation
- learn/use keras and tensorflow
- using Colab for running Notebook with GPU
